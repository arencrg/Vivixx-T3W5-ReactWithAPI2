# Challenge: Create a react app that will a public API. Use Bootstrap 4.

I did this app last week (the repo for that can be found [here](https://github.com/arencrg/VIvixx-T3W4-ReactWithAPI)), but I'm not really happy with that one, and to be honest, it's not... new. So I wanted to make a new one. Here it is. This project uses a language detection API to get its data.
